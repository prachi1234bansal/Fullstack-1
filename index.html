    <P><B> Hello </B>everyone,today we <b>learn</b> about <strong>Html inline elements</strong> </P>

    <p>These HTML Inline Elements are also called phrase elements because theyâ€™re
     intended to wrap around a short string of a few words, or even a single word, to give it added meaning and formatting that sets it apart from the other words that surround it. Text elements in HTML come in two basic flavors: physical and logical.

     Physical elements, such as <B> for bold and <I> for italic, are used to specify how text should be displayed.
 Logical elements, such as <STRONG> and <EM>, indicate what text is, but not necessarily how it should look.
